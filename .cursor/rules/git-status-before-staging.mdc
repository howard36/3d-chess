# Before Commit Rule

Before committing any git changes, always run the appropriate tests (`npm run test` in the `client/` directory, or `pytest` in the `server/` directory) and use `git status -s` to see all the files that have changed. This ensures you do not miss any untracked or modified files and helps maintain transparency and completeness in your commits.

This rule applies to all contributors and should be followed before every `git add` operation.
