# Git Status Before Staging Rule

Before staging any git changes, always run `git status -s` to see all the files that have changed. This ensures you do not miss any untracked or modified files and helps maintain transparency and completeness in your commits.

Example:

```
git status -s
```

This rule applies to all contributors and should be followed before every `git add` operation.
